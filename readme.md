### To run:
  * `python3 bezier.py`
  * optionally, `python3 bezier.py <smoothness integer>; e.g `python3 bezier.py 20`

##Functionality:
  * click and drag blue control points (slowly!) to see how the bezier curve reacts
  * see screengrabs folder

## Coloring:
  * Large blue points: initial control points
  * Yellow points are midpoints
  * Orange lines define the bounding triangle
  * Pink points define curve a (defined by the points dcasta)
  * Pink points define curve b (defined by the points dcastb)
  * Green points define curve c (defined by the points dcastc)

##Possible Extensions:
  * Given 3 points that define a curve (or, perhaps a unit circle), find the control points and approximate the curve
  * Recursive algorithm for DeCasteljau
